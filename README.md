## Getting Started

**Tic Tac TRONIX 2000 , is a game based on the classic Tic Tac Toe Game. It's
played in a similar way, main diference are: a) you play on the screen of the
computer, b) you choose a number to leave your mark (X's or O's)**

INSTRUCTIONS: to play select "Yes", you'll be asked to introduce the name of
both Players. Once set up, players will take turns to leave their marks (X's or
O's) on the board. The player who first has 3 marks in a row wins the game."

RULES

1. The game is played on a grid that's 3x3 squares.
2. Player One is X's and Player Two is 0's.
3. X always starts the game.
4. Players take turns putting their marks in unselected
   squares.
5. The first player to get 3 marks in a row (up,
   down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
6. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over.
   If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends
   in a tie.

On every turn, each player will be asked to choose a valid number that represents a
space in the board, this number will be replaced for the player's in turn mark
or symbol X's or O's.

The **winner** will be the first player that gets 3 marks in one line (Vertical,
Horizontal or Diagonal)

**Draw** is when all spaces of the board are taken without a winning combination
or when there are still spaces available in the board but there are no more
positions that lead to a win situation.

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.
